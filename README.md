## Introduction

This idea of this project is to organize photos from our cell phones to the
`Camera Uploads` directory at Dropbox. The problem faced when using Dropbox to 
store your photos is related to how to organize it. The photos are just uploaded
to the directory and there is no mechanism to organize it by device, date or
any other criteria.
